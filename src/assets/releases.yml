      title: LuvSound at Sugar Maple
      cover: http://live.luvsound.org/recordings/sugarmaple-2010-08-10/settingup.jpg
      about: |
        In August of 2010 six new and old LuvSounders gathered at the Sugar Maple in Milwaukee for a rousing evening of improvised electronic music. This was a first meeting for many of us, and the duos - the combinations were selected with chance operations - were mostly first-time collaborations. The night ended with a rawkus full group jam, and here are the vibrations to prove it.

        This was the first of hopefully many such events, and we'll continue to share the results here. Enjoy!

      about: |
        This is the third part of a four part improvised performance at McKeown's Books in New Orleans recorded in June of 2008.

        The evening was a first meeting for long time Luvsounders Bryan Teoh (Always Tokyo) Kevin Gipson (AllThatFall) and Erik Schoster (He Can Jog)

        This section of the performance was inspired by first meetings and old-and-new friendships. Most of the field recordings we used in the performance were recorded in New Orleans or on the Amtrak journey from NYC to NOLA including some from Open Sound New Orleans' Jacob Brancasi and Heather Booth.

        This was part of the Difficult Music series at McKeown's Books and we're very grateful to Maggie McKeown for hosting the event and helping to bring us all together. If you're in the New Orleans area, the series is ongoing and well worth checking out: mckeownsbooks.com/events.html

      title: Magnifications
      release_date: 2009-03-01
      onesheet: https://archive.org/download/luv022/luv022_onesheet.pdf
      about: |
        Magnifications is a rumbling and gentle beast of exploded 
        cello work that often sounds as much like the shimmering of 
        an orchestra of cymbals as it does the vibrations of a cello 
        string. Ted Laderas aka OO-Ray creates his sonic monsters with 
        a studied combination of digital and analog processing techniques. 
        The project is mostly improvised and then meticulously tempered 
        in the studio - though both "Milky" and "Sfumato" are raw live 
        recordings. The result of years of personal reinvention from his 
        home base of Portland Oregon, Magnifications is a solid document 
        of shoegaze magic and tightly layered electroacoustic goodness.

        Following his tenure with electro band Ainu, Ted Laderas wanted 
        a change of direction. "I want to drown the listener in a sea of 
        sound. Distortion is so beautiful to me." A few years ago, he 
        started taking cello lessons, and as he found his feet with the 
        instrument he started to record, and eventually process. Over 
        those years the OO-Ray was born.

        Searching excursions into the woods, poetry-to-frequency converting Max/MSP patches, and the appropriation of a university's bell tower p.a. system are just some of the myriad elements which comprise Matthew Mullane's "The Whole Moon Gleams in Every Pool." A studied work in the efferent and the afferent, Matthew's work seeks to explore the interface between the projection of sound and its audition.

        Matthew Mullane is a student, sound artist, performing musician and writer currently living in Ohio. His sound work differs greatly from release to release while his written work focuses on aesthetics and art theory.

      about: |
        remakes of lara is eight reworkings of lara brodsky's piece for voice and loop pedal, offering the mandala. 
        nearly a year ago we approached lara about centering a luvsound project around her piece. a few seasons later, 
        the work has been put through eight different reimaginings, including one by lara herself. we're incredibly 
        excited with the results. each remake explores the source material from a different and interesting angle, 
        exploding the original into a nearly hour long meditiation. please brew a pot of tea, find a comfortable spot, and enjoy.

      about: |
            Sebastian Krueger of Inlets just needs a little room. Growing up in a large prairie-style 
            home in Madison, Wisconsin, he became possessed with a certain notion of infinite space. 
            His method is compact and intimate - a solitary Shure microphone details the puff of a 
            clarinet as closely as reverberations in the creases of his pillow - but these bedroom 
            recordings sprawl with occluded heartfelt colors and shimmer with the accidents of 
            expansion. Here, whole conversations bloom and senesce in quick moments between notes; 
            single hushed voices persist and then suddenly are buttressed by myriad more. This is 
            music that riots and rushes in the world of multi-track recording software, but which 
            still retains a terse narrative course and an ear to beautiful detail.

            Apart from Inlets, Sebastian enjoys the privilege of playing in My Brightest Diamond; 
            supporting Shara Worden with guitars, clarinets, bells and falsetto. He contributes to 
            her forthcoming record A Thousand Shark's Teeth.

      artist: Benjamin J Mansavage Klein
      title: A Hymn To Zoltan Abbassid
      about: |
        A Hymn to Zoltan Abbassid is a dense and spectral tuba-laptop drone, maybe in the tradition of Tony Conrad. Benjamin's tuba cuts deep and smothers - partials ringing out like decades old tape noise. The source recordings for this piece were taken from an improvisation in Amsterdam earlier in the year. Mastered at PanicStudios by John McCaig.

        Benjamin J Mansavage Klein grew up in Sheboygan, Wisconsin attending Catholic Mass on Saturday nights and his father's Protestant church service on Sunday morning. It makes sense then that Benjamin identifies the best with hymns sung by warbly old church ladies accompanied by out of tune pianos. The Sheboygan county area is best known for its golf, bratwurst, and toilet industry; Benjamin is most familiar with the last of these, spending a number of summers manufacturing toilet seats for the Bemis Company, and he admits that this has lead to an industrial tinge on his ear. A member of the improv group ICELU (luv004) Benjamin tries to explore everything you are not supposed to do with a tuba. He currently resides in a transitive state, traveling abroad from August 1, 2005 to August 1, 2006.

            LuvSound is pleased to announce this carefully sculpted ep from Berlin's Stephane Leonard

            TRi is all about connecting loose ends.
            In between spheric and dreamlike soundscapes up to the harsh cut up
            music concrete, pieces of field recordings taken from all over the
            globe emerge. Stephane Leonard´s music creates a unique atmosphere that
            immediantly draws the attention of the listener. Out of a self coded
            max-msp software, a microphone and a small selection of external sound
            sources small sensitive universes stream together. While listening they
            expand further into the realms of imagination and thus take precise
            looks at the nature of the world around us. With the perfectionists
            love to detail, Stephane's compositions build bridges which hold for
            even the most lost of characters.

            Stephane Leonard was born in 1979 in Berlin, Germany. After beginning
            his studies in philosophy and art-history in 2001 at the
            Humboldt-University in Berlin, he studied Fine Arts at the University
            of the Arts in Bremen for 4 years. Being a student of the artist Paco
            Knöller, a former student of well known german artist Joseph Beuys,
            Stephane's focus has been drawn into various directions of artistic
            expression. By trying to experience the arts from various different
            perspectives he has created large scale drawings and paintings,
            illustrations for cd covers, numerous short & experimental films/videos
            as well as music videos. As a musician and composer, Stephane has
            written and recorded music since 1995. The different ways of
            expressions and art forms are mutually conditional and inspiring the
            influence of one another.

            Stephane Leonard is actively involved in the contemporary art and
            music scene in Berlin and Bremen, performing with improv groups
            JuliJuni, Leo Mars Ensemble and plastic doll. He also collaborates with
            various bands, video artists, filmmakers and solo performers
            (dis.playce, Seidenmatt, Marcel Türkowsky, Claudio Pfeifer). Moreover
            he is a member of the naiv super artist collective that publishes and
            promotes modern composers, adventurous musicians and the naivsuperFilm
            collective.

            His work has been shown in exhibitions in Berlin, Hamburg, Bremen,
            Neubrandenburg, Vienna, Zürich, Massachusetts and Bangkok. Stephane
            lives and works in Berlin, Brooklyn and Bremen.

        We're very happy to announce the debut solo recording from 
        Italian Max/MSP maverick, Hellospiral. 

        Born in Italy, where he lives and works, Hellospiral is Giacomo 
        Governatori, a sociologist/guitarist. In 1995 he was the guitar 
        hero of his block, in 1999 he founded a post-punk-noise band 
        named "Edible Woman" whose CD "Spare/me calf" came out in 2001. 
        At the same time he devotes himself to electronic composition 
        alternating his passion for melody and for noises, still 
        uncertain of what attracts him more. Equally influenced by 
        Gilles Deleuze and Brian Wilson, Hellospiral explores the 
        pop/avantgarde dialectics hoping never to arrive at a proper 
        synthesis.

        The EP also features remixes by LuvSound regulars 
        Bryan Teoh and He Can Jog.

        and Dis.Playce rounds the release out with a live remix of 
        their recent full length on NaivSuper. Enjoy!

      about: |
        A fifteen minute exercise in blissful and tortured improvisation 
        for piano and laptop is the first solo luvsound contribution 
            from Wisconsin's Bryan Teoh (also a member of ICELU). 
            Bryan's primary instrument is guitar, but it's clear he 
            operates just as well striking strings as he does plucking 
            them. Bones break, strings vibrate, on a landscape.

        kevin gipson (allthatfall) has a way with tiny sounds. his samples 
        sometimes flow and sometimes fight - guitars crashing through 
        a quintet of humming radiators or maybe the fey voices of 
        children and passersby. it's probably because he sometimes 
        records as panda kommander that i can't shake the image of 
        monochrome figures of panda bears bubbling out of his 
        synthesizers like so many angled bleeps and crackles... 
        pandacore!

      about: |
        ICELU's music lies somewhere between the vague orbits of 
        european free improvisation, dada, and ambient microsound. 
        Catchy categories aside, the golden brown bake of the midwest 
        is what really makes this music special to me. There's a 
        playful seriousness to ICELU that seems indebted to their 
        Wisconsin dispositions - harsh noise can be giggled away, 
        and impossibly fragile soundscapes feel like a familiar 
        handshake. This isn't music for the recital hall. It's music 
        for armchairs, couches, and new friends.
